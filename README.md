# Old Roblox Script Builder Scripts

From beginning, I was a huge fan of open-source coding.  I was thinking: if there was place where I can see other people's code, I could very well improve my own practices.  I started making this repository to help beginners with [Roblox Lua](http://developer.roblox.com), so they can help continue Powering Imaginationâ„¢.

## What Are Script Builders?

Script builders are a type of virtual Roblox experience.
These experiences allow you to execute code, which is mostly a popular hangout place for scripters.
However, many scripters provide free scripts for non-scripters to experiment with in these enivronments.
Therefore, people are able to run scripts such as the ones provided in this repo in such experiences.

## Fair Warning

A large portion of these scripts are old and date back to 8+ years.
Likewise, these scripts have not been maintained since then.
Roblox has been changed their code infrastructure many times and none of these scripts are still guaranteed to work.
Also, for similar reasons the way to execute scripts in Script Builders have changed over time.

## Before Using It

Don't forget that there are people out there who need scripting  help, so *let's make sure to make their experience an educational one*.

## How to Use

As of 2-12-23, the most reliable Script Builder experience that is still actively maintained is Void Script Builder, which can be found [here].
This specific script builder is based on execution through Pastebin/Hastebin links.
To execute the scripts in this repository, firstly export the file of your choice into a raw text pastebin/hastebin document.
Then, join the Void Script Builder, and in the bottom left command line enter "hl/(link here)" and press enter to run it.
